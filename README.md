# Global_mapping_root_mass_fraction

## This repository contains the code used for the analysis in the paper "The global biogeography of above- versus belowground plant biomass allocation"

#### The code is organized as follows:

[**The folder of RSR_Geospatial_Modeling**](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_root_shoot_ratio/tree/master/RSR_Geospatial_Modeling) contains most of the scripts that create the main results of the manuscript.

[**The folder of RSR_data**](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_root_shoot_ratio/tree/master/RSR_data) contains the data that shall be used for analysis.
