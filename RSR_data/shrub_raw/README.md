Here we separate the whold records into 5 different biome level reigons. There is no data sacrifice during this process.

Below are the dataset information:

- "system.index": index defined by the system;
- "index": indices that are used to identify each unique record;
- "latitude": latitude of each record;
- "longitude": longitude of each record;
- "ratio": root-shoot-ratio of each record;
- ".geo": geometry information of each record as a spatial feature.
