# RSR geospatial modeling

#### This folder contains folder that represent the main results from the paper.

[**The folder Data_cleaning**](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_root_shoot_ratio/tree/master/RSR_Geospatial_Modeling/Data_cleaning) contains the scripts that clean the raw data and prepare the data for further analysis.

[**The folder Mapping and modelling**](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_root_shoot_ratio/tree/master/RSR_Geospatial_Modeling/Mapping%20and%20modelling) contains the scripts that create RMF distribution maps and evaluating modelling uncertainties.

[**The folder Biomass_computation**](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_root_shoot_ratio/tree/master/RSR_Geospatial_Modeling/Biomass_computation) contains the scripts that explore the distribution of belowground biomass and calculation of total amount of biomass carbon across the globe in three vegetation types.

[**The folder RMF_controllers**](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_root_shoot_ratio/tree/master/RSR_Geospatial_Modeling/RMF_controllers) contains the scripts that provide mechanistic understanding of environmental effects on the variation of RMFs.
