# Belowground biomass caclulation and summarizing.

#### The RMF map is used as a tool to convert aboveground biomass to belowground biomass in each vegetation type.


**To get the aboveground biomass from IPCC estimation, the scripts named:**
  - 'forest_abovemass.js', 
  - 'grass_abovemass.js' and 
  - 'shrub_abovemass.js' 
  can be used for converting recent estimation of total biomass carbon to aboveground biomass in each vegetattion type.
  
  
**To calculate belowground biomass density from rmf maps and aboveground biomass density, the scripts named:**
  - 'forest_belowground_biomass_density.js',
  - 'grass_belowground_biomass_density.js' and 
  - 'shrub_belowground_biomass_density.js'
  can be applied.
  
**To summarize and get the mean and other relevant layers from different biomass density layers from 'xxx_belowground_biomass.js', the scripts named:**
  - 'forest_belowground_biomass_summary.js',
  - 'grass_belowground_biomass_density.js' and 
  - 'shrub_belowground_biomass_density.js'
  can be applied.
  
**To calculate the total amount of belowground biomass in different vegetation types, scripts named:**
  - 'forest_belowmass_calcu.js',
  - 'grass_belowmass_calcu.js' and
  - 'shrub_belowmass_calcu.js'
  can be applied.
